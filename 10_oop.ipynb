    "In Python, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data (objects) and functions (methods). It allows for code reuse, modularity, and a more intuitive structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Class**:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of the objects, including their attributes (variables) and methods (functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Object**:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It is created by calling the class as if it were a function. Each object can have its own unique set of attributes and methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Class:\n",
    "A class is defined using the `class` keyword. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2):\n",
    "        # Constructor method to initialize attributes\n",
    "        self.attribute1 = parameter1\n",
    "        self.attribute2 = parameter2\n",
    "\n",
    "    def method_name(self):\n",
    "        # A method inside the class\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the class\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__init__(self)`**: This is the constructor method, which is called when an object of the class is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "- **`self`**: Refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Class Definition and Object Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Car: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object (instance) of the class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing attributes and calling methods\n",
    "print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: 2021 Toyota Camry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes**: These are variables that belong to the class or an object of that class. In the example above, `make`, `model`, and `year` are attributes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Methods**: These are functions that belong to the class and define the behaviors of the objects. `display_info()` is a method in the `Car` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiating an Object:\n",
    "To create an object, you call the class as if it were a function. This will invoke the `__init__` method and return an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2020)\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Ford\", \"Mustang\", 2022)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object (`car1`, `car2`) has its own set of attributes and can use the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, containing methods and attributes.\n",
    "- An **object** is an instance of a class, created by calling the class with necessary arguments.\n",
    "- The `__init__` method initializes the object's attributes when it is created.\n",
    "- Methods define the behavior of the class and can be called on objects.\n"

    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), **attributes** and **methods** are the key components that define the behavior and characteristics of a class and its instances (objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Attributes**:\n",
    "Attributes are variables that belong to a class or an instance of a class. They store the data or state related to an object. There are two types of attributes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Attributes**: These are attributes tied to specific instances (objects) of the class. They are typically initialized in the `__init__` method.\n",
    "- **Class Attributes**: These are attributes that are shared across all instances of the class. They are defined directly inside the class but outside any methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Methods**:\n",
    "Methods are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. They can access and modify the attributes of the class or perform other operations. Methods are called on an object, and they can modify the object’s state or return information about the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Methods**: These are the most common type of methods that operate on instance attributes. They always take `self` as the first parameter.\n",
    "- **Class Methods**: These are methods that operate on class-level data and are marked with the `@classmethod` decorator. They take `cls` as the first parameter.\n",
    "- **Static Methods**: These are methods that do not operate on instance or class data. They are marked with the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",

    "2. **Derived Class (Subclass)**: The class that inherits from the base class.\n",
    "3. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: The structure that defines the relationships between the base and derived classes.\n",
    "4. **Method Overriding**: Subclasses can provide their own version of a method that is already defined in the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Inheritance:\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: You can define common functionality in the base class and reuse it in the derived class.\n",
    "- **Extend Functionality**: A subclass can extend or modify the behavior of the base class without changing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "To inherit a class, use the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DerivedClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class (Parent class)\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} makes a sound.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Derived class (Child class)\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        # Call to the base class constructor (using super())\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} barks.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects of the classes\n",
    "animal = Animal(\"Animal\")\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling methods\n",
    "animal.speak()  # Output: Animal makes a sound.\n",
    "dog.speak()     # Output: Buddy barks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Calling the Base Class Constructor**: In the derived class, you can call the constructor of the base class using `super().__init__()` to initialize attributes from the base class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Overriding Methods**: A derived class can override methods from the base class to provide its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The `super()` Function**: The `super()` function is used to call methods from the base class. This is useful for accessing inherited methods and constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Method Overriding:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, color):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Initialize from the base class\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Overriding the speak method\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} chirps.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "bird = Bird(\"Sparrow\", \"Brown\")\n",
    "bird.speak()  # Output: Sparrow chirps.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance in Python:\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from a single base class.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class DerivedClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one base class.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a derived class, forming a chain.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class SubDerivedClass(DerivedClass):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from the same base class.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class DerivedClass1(BaseClass):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class DerivedClass2(BaseClass):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of multiple types of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Inheritance** allows a class to inherit functionality from another class, reducing redundancy"
