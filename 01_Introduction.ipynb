    "Python is a programming language with a rich history that dates back to the late 1980s. It was created by **Guido van Rossum**, a Dutch programmer, who wanted to design a language that was both easy to read and powerful. Here’s a brief timeline of Python’s history:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Milestones in Python’s History:\n",
    "1. **1989**: Guido van Rossum began working on Python as a successor to the ABC language, aiming to address its shortcomings.\n",
    "2. **1991**: Python 0.9.0 was released, featuring basic functionality like exception handling, functions, and core data types (lists, dicts, strings).\n",
    "3. **1994**: Python 1.0 was released, introducing functional programming tools like `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.\n",
    "4. **2000**: Python 2.0 was released, adding features like list comprehensions, garbage collection, and the `unicode` type.\n",
    "5. **2008**: Python 3.0 was released, a major update that was not backward-compatible with Python 2. It focused on removing redundancy and improving code readability.\n",
    "6. **2020**: Python 2.7, the last version of Python 2, reached its end of life, and the community fully transitioned to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why the Name \"Python\"?\n",
    "Guido van Rossum named the language after the British comedy series **\"Monty Python’s Flying Circus\"**, as he was a fan of the show. The name reflects the language’s fun and approachable nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python’s Growth:\n",
    "- Python has grown into one of the most popular programming languages in the world.\n",
    "- It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.\n",
    "- Python’s simplicity and versatility have made it a favorite among beginners and experts alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Code:\n",
    "Here’s a simple Python program to calculate the sum of two numbers, showcasing Python’s readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a simple Python program to add two numbers\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 10\n",

    "Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that stands out due to its unique features. These features make Python a popular choice for beginners and professionals alike. Below are some of the key features of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Simple and Easy to Learn**\n",
    "   - Python has a clean and readable syntax, similar to the English language.\n",
    "   - It emphasizes simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Simple Python code to print numbers\n",
    "     for i in range(5):\n",
    "         print(i)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Interpreted Language**\n",
    "   - Python is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line by line.\n",
    "   - This makes debugging easier and allows for immediate feedback during development.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # No need to compile; just run the code directly\n",
    "     print(\"Hello, Python!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **High-Level Language**\n",
    "   - Python abstracts low-level details like memory management, making it easier to focus on problem-solving.\n",
    "   - Developers don’t need to worry about hardware-specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**\n",
    "   - Python is portable and runs on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.\n",
    "   - Code written on one platform can easily run on another without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Dynamically Typed**\n",
    "   - Python does not require explicit declaration of variable types.\n",
    "   - The type of a variable is determined at runtime.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Dynamic typing in Python\n",
    "     x = 10        # x is an integer\n",
    "     x = \"Python\"  # x is now a string\n",
    "     print(x)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Large Standard Library**\n",
    "   - Python comes with a rich set of built-in modules and libraries for tasks like file handling, web development, data analysis, and more.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Using the math module from the standard library\n",
    "     import math\n",
    "     print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Object-Oriented and Procedural**\n",
    "   - Python supports both object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming paradigms.\n",
    "   - Example (OOP):\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # A simple class in Python\n",
    "     class Dog:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "             self.name = name\n",
    "         def bark(self):\n",
    "             print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "     my_dog.bark()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. **Extensible and Embeddable**\n",
    "   - Python can be extended with C/C++ for performance-critical tasks.\n",
    "   - It can also be embedded into other applications to provide scripting capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. **Open Source and Free**\n",
    "   - Python is open-source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute it freely.\n",
    "   - It has a large and active community that contributes to its development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. **Versatile Applications**\n",
    "   - Python is used in a wide range of fields, including:\n",
    "     - Web Development (Django, Flask)\n",
    "     - Data Science and Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow)\n",
    "     - Automation and Scripting\n",
    "     - Scientific Computing\n",
    "     - Game Development (Pygame)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Code:\n",
    "Here’s a simple Python program that demonstrates some of these features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A Python program showcasing simplicity, dynamic typing, and standard library usage\n",
