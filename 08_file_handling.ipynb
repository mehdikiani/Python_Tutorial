    "In Python, file handling refers to the process of reading from and writing to files. You can interact with files by opening them, performing operations, and closing them once you're done. Python provides several built-in functions to work with files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Opening a File**\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in Python, you use the built-in `open()` function. The basic syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('filename', 'mode')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `'filename'` is the name of the file (including the file extension, e.g., `data.txt`).\n",
    "- `'mode'` is the mode in which the file will be opened. Some common modes include:\n",
    "  - `'r'` (read): Opens the file for reading (default mode).\n",
    "  - `'w'` (write): Opens the file for writing (creates a new file or truncates an existing one).\n",
    "  - `'a'` (append): Opens the file for appending (creates a new file if it doesn't exist).\n",
    "  - `'b'` (binary): Used for binary files, often combined with other modes (e.g., `'rb'` for reading binary).\n",
    "  - `'x'` (exclusive creation): Creates a new file but raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of opening a file for reading:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of opening a file for writing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('output.txt', 'w')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Closing a File**\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've finished working with a file, you should always close it using the `close()` method to free up system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of closing a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Best Practice: Using `with` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a best practice to use the `with` statement when opening a file. This ensures that the file is automatically closed after the block of code is executed, even if an error occurs within the block. Using `with` is recommended over manually calling `file.close()` because it handles file closing more efficiently and safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of using `with` statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the file is automatically closed once the block inside the `with` statement is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points:\n",
    "- Use `open('filename', 'mode')` to open a file in Python.\n",
    "- Always close the file after use with `file.close()`.\n",
    "- Use `with open(...)` to automatically handle file closing.\n",
    "```\n"

    "Once a file is opened in the appropriate mode, you can perform read and write operations on it. Python provides various methods for reading and writing data from and to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Reading from Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to read the content of a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) `read()`\n",
    "The `read()` method reads the entire content of the file and returns it as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) `readline()`\n",
    "The `readline()` method reads a single line from the file at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To read all lines in a file one by one, you can use a loop with `readline()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    while line:\n",
    "        print(line, end='')  # `end=''` to avoid double newline\n",
    "        line = file.readline()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) `readlines()`\n",
    "The `readlines()` method reads all lines of a file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    print(lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item in the list is a line from the file, including the newline character (`\\n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Writing to Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write to files using the `write()` and `writelines()` methods. Before writing, make sure the file is opened in the appropriate mode (either `'w'` for writing or `'a'` for appending).\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) `write()`\n",
    "The `write()` method writes a string to the file. If the file is opened in `'w'` mode, it will overwrite the existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\")\n",
    "    file.write(\"Writing to files in Python.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) `writelines()`\n",
    "The `writelines()` method writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines = [\"Hello, World!\\n\", \"Writing to files in Python.\\n\"]\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Appending to Files\n",
    "If you want to add new content to the end of the file without overwriting the existing content, you can use the append mode (`'a'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"\\nAppending new content.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **File Modes Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read (default mode).\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write (overwrites the file).\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append (adds content at the end of the file).\n",
    "- `'rb'`, `'wb'`: Binary read/write.\n",
    "- `'r+'`: Read and write.\n",
    "- `'w+'`: Write and read (overwrites the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Key Points:**\n",
    "- Use `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()` to read file content.\n",
    "- Use `write()` or `writelines()` to write data to files.\n",
    "- Always handle file reading/writing carefully to avoid data loss.\n",
    "- Use `'r'` to read, `'w'` to write, and `'a'` to append to files.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains the methods to read from and write to files in Python. It covers basic file operations like reading entire files, reading lines, and writing data to files. The section also highlights the differences between file modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`) and their usage.\n",
