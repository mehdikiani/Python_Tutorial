    "In Python, errors can be broadly categorized into two types: **Syntax Errors** and **Exceptions**. Understanding the difference between them is crucial for debugging and handling errors effectively in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
    "   - A **Syntax Error** occurs when Python cannot interpret the code because it does not follow the correct syntax or structure of the language.\n",
    "   - These errors are typically caused by typos, missing punctuation, incorrect indentation, or other structural issues in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example of Syntax Error:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Hello, World!\"  # Missing closing parenthesis\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Common causes of Syntax Errors:\n",
    "   - Missing parentheses or brackets.\n",
    "   - Improper indentation.\n",
    "   - Typing mistakes in keywords or function names.\n",
    "   - Incorrectly placed colons (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `def`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - An **Exception** occurs when Python encounters an error during the execution of a program, even though the syntax is correct.\n",
    "   - Exceptions are typically raised when something goes wrong while the program is running, such as trying to access an undefined variable or dividing by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example of an Exception:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 5\n",
    "   y = 0\n",
    "   result = x / y  # Division by zero\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Common types of exceptions:\n",
    "   - **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when dividing a number by zero.\n",
    "   - **NameError**: Raised when trying to use a variable that has not been defined.\n",
    "   - **TypeError**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "   - **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "   - **IndexError**: Raised when trying to access an element in a list or string using an index that is out of range.\n",
    "   - **KeyError**: Raised when trying to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of an Exception:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1: NameError\n",
    "print(undeclared_variable)  # Variable has not been defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "NameError: name 'undeclared_variable' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 2: IndexError\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(my_list[5])  # Index out of range\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Differences between Syntax Errors and Exceptions:\n",
    "| Aspect                | Syntax Errors                          | Exceptions                        |\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks are used for **error handling**. These blocks allow you to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully without crashing your program. The `finally` block is used for clean-up actions that must be executed no matter what.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`try` Block**:\n",
    "   - The `try` block is used to wrap the code that might raise an exception. If no exception occurs, the code runs as usual. If an exception is raised, the control is passed to the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "       print(10 / number)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`except` Block**:\n",
    "   - The `except` block catches the exception raised in the `try` block. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch or catch all exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example (Handling ZeroDivisionError):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "       print(10 / number)\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example (Catching any Exception):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "       print(10 / number)\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`finally` Block**:\n",
    "   - The `finally` block will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is useful for cleanup tasks such as closing files, releasing resources, or logging actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example (Using `finally`):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "       # Perform some file operations\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       print(\"This will run no matter what.\")\n",
    "       # Clean up: close the file if it was opened\n",
    "       if 'file' in locals():\n",
    "           file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Catching Multiple Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - You can use multiple `except` blocks to handle different exceptions separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "       print(10 / number)\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       print(\"Invalid input, please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Using `else` Block**:\n",
    "   - An optional `else` block can be used after all `except` blocks. It is executed if no exception occurs in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "       result = 10 / number\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       print(\"Execution finished.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Error Handling with `try`, `except`, and `finally`:\n",
    "- **`try`**: Contains code that may raise an exception.\n",
    "- **`except`**: Catches and handles the exception.\n",
    "- **`finally`**: Executes cleanup actions, whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "- **`else`**: Runs if no exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Complete Error Handling with All Blocks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / number\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"The result of division is: {result}\")\n",

    "In Python, the expression `if 'file' in locals():` checks whether the variable `file` exists in the current local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`locals()`**:\n",
    "   - `locals()` is a built-in function that returns a dictionary representing the current local symbol table. The local symbol table is where Python stores variables, functions, and other objects that are local to the current scope (such as inside a function or block of code).\n",
    "   - When called, `locals()` returns a dictionary where the keys are the names of variables, and the values are their corresponding values in the current local scope.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For example, if you have the following code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "   y = 20\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Then `locals()` will return:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   {'x': 10, 'y': 20}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`'file'` enclosed in quotes**:\n",
    "   - The `'file'` is enclosed in quotes because it is a string representing the name of the variable. The `in` keyword checks whether the string `'file'` (the variable name) is present in the dictionary returned by `locals()`.\n",
    "   - This is a way of checking if the variable `file` exists in the local scope, not if a file object with that name exists. The quotes are necessary because the `in` operator is being used to check for a key in the dictionary, and dictionary keys must be strings (not variables or objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why check if the variable exists with `'file' in locals()`?**\n",
    "   - This is a safety check. Before you attempt to call `file.close()`, you want to ensure that the variable `file` actually exists and has been initialized. If it doesn’t exist, calling `file.close()` would raise an error.\n",
    "   - It’s useful in situations where the `file` might not have been opened due to an error, or it might not have been defined due to conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we open a file and ensure that it is closed properly, only if it was successfully opened:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "    # Perform some file operations\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    if 'file' in locals():  # Check if 'file' is defined in the local scope\n",
    "        file.close()  # Safely close the file if it was opened\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - If the `open()` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist), `file` will not be defined, and thus `'file' in locals()` will return `False`. In that case, the `file.close()` line will not be executed, preventing an `AttributeError`.\n",
    "  - If the file is opened successfully, `'file' in locals()` will return `True`, and the file will be closed properly in the `finally` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- **`locals()`** returns the dictionary of the local scope.\n",
    "- **`'file'`** is a string representing the name of the variable `file`.\n",
    "- Checking `'file' in locals()` ensures the variable exists before trying to perform any operations on it, like `file.close()`."

    "In Python, you can raise exceptions manually using the `raise` statement. This allows you to generate custom exceptions when certain conditions are met, giving you control over the flow of your program and how errors are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax of `raise`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ExceptionType`**: The type of the exception to be raised (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.).\n",
    "- **`\"Error message\"`**: A message that will be passed along with the exception, explaining the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Raising a Basic Exception:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Raising a generic exception with a custom message\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Something went wrong!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raising Specific Exceptions:\n",
    "You can raise specific built-in exceptions or even create your own custom exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raising `ValueError`**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = -5\n",
    "   if num < 0:\n",
    "       raise ValueError(\"Number cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raising `TypeError`**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "       if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):\n",
    "           raise TypeError(\"Both arguments must be integers.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "   add_numbers(5, \"3\")  # This will raise TypeError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "You can create your own custom exceptions by subclassing the built-in `Exception` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Raising the custom exception\n",
    "raise MyCustomError(\"This is a custom error.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Raising an Exception in a Function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the function\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `raise` in `try` and `except` Blocks:\n",
    "You can also raise exceptions within `try` blocks to re-raise the caught exception or raise a new exception after catching an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 18:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Age must be 18 or older.\")\n",
    "    print(\"Age is valid.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    validate_age(15)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "    raise  # Re-raise the exception after logging\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `raise` without an Exception:\n",
    "You can also use `raise` without specifying an exception type. In this case, it re-raises the last exception that was caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 1 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught a ZeroDivisionError!\")\n",
    "    raise  # Re-raises the same exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- The `raise` statement allows you to manually raise exceptions in your program.\n",
    "- You can raise built-in exceptions like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.\n",
    "- Custom exceptions can be created by subclassing the `Exception` class.\n",
    "- Use `raise` in `try`, `except`, or `finally` blocks to control error flow and to provide custom error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates how to raise exceptions in Python and how to create and use custom exceptions to handle errors more effectively.\n",
