    "## Conditional Statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if` Statement\n",
    "The `if` statement checks whether a condition evaluates to `True` or `False`. If the condition is `True`, the associated code block executes; otherwise, the program moves past the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if x is greater than 5\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `elif` Statement\n",
    "The `elif` (else-if) statement checks another condition only if the previous `if` condition was false. It is often used to add multiple conditions in a single statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Determine whether x or y is greater\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "if x > y:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than y\")\n",
    "elif y > x:\n",
    "    print(\"y is greater than x\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x and y are equal\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `else` Statement\n",
    "The `else` statement executes when the preceding `if` or `elif` condition(s) are false. It's useful for providing a default action when none of the conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if x is not negative\n",
    "x = -2\n",
    "if x >= 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is non-negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",

    "## Loops: `for` and `while`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `for` Loop\n",
    "A `for` loop iterates over each item in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and executes the body of the loop for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterate over letters in \"hello\"\n",
    "for letter in \"hello\":\n",
    "    print(letter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `while` Loop\n",
    "A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`. It continues until the condition becomes false, making it useful for indefinite iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Count while x is less than 10\n",
    "x = 0\n",
    "while x < 10:\n",
    "    x += 1\n",
    "print(\"Loop ended when x reached\", x)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Loop Control: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `break`\n",
    "The `break` statement stops the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration or exits the loop entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterate over a list and break when an element meets a condition\n",
    "for element in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n",
    "    if element == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(element)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `continue`\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Skip even numbers in a range\n",
    "for number in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `pass`\n",
    "The `pass` statement does nothing but allows you to write an empty loop body without causing an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# An empty for loop\n",
    "for _ in range(5):\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "## Combining Control Flow and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Control Structures\n",
    "You can nest control structures within each other, such as placing an `if` statement inside a `while` loop or another `if`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A nested if-else inside a while loop\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "while x > 0:\n",
    "    if x % 2 == 0:\n",

    "### Using `if` Statements with Loops\n",

    "total = 0\n",
    "for number in range(1, 11):\n",

    "## Error Handling in Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks can help manage exceptions that might occur during conditional or loop execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate square root, handle ValueError\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import math\n",
    "    sqrt = math.sqrt(9)\n",
    "    print(\"Square root of 9 is\", sqrt)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred: invalid argument\")\n",
    "finally:\n",

    "## Best Practices for Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**: Use meaningful variable names and break down complex conditions into multiple `if` statements for clarity.\n",
    "2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent indentation to make the code structure obvious.\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary nested structures when simple condition checks suffice.\n",
    "4. **DRY Principle**: Refrain from repeating similar logic across loops unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Control flow in Python is essential for creating dynamic and interactive programs. By mastering `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, and `while` constructs, along with their control keywords (`break`, `continue`, `pass`), you can effectively manage program execution paths and implement complex logic. Practice with various examples will enhance your ability to use these constructs confidently in future coding projects."
